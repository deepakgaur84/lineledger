/**
 * Nightly proof that the books still reconcile. Six checks per company:
 *
 *   1. Audit hash chain — delegated to {@see VerifyAccountingAuditCommand}.
 *   2. Double-entry balance — every posted journal nets to zero across the GL,
 *      so SUM(debit_cents - credit_cents) over all posted lines must be 0.
 *   3. Balance-cache drift — accounts.balance_cents is a denormalized hint that
 *      reports ignore, but drift signals a posting bug, so we recompute each
 *      account from its posted lines and compare. --fix heals the cache.
 *   4. Document paid-cache drift — invoices/bills amount_paid_cents against the
 *      live applications of posted receipts and payments. --fix reposts.
 *   5. Tax on a control-account cheque line — report-only; see
 *      {@see checkControlAccountTax()}.
 *   6. Foreign units left by a void — report-only; see
 *      {@see checkVoidForeignUnits()}.
 *
 * On any failure it logs, emails ops (unless --no-alert), and exits non-zero so
 * a scheduler/CI run surfaces it. The accumulating run history is also exactly
 * the "we monitor that controls operate" evidence a SOC 2 Type II audit wants.
